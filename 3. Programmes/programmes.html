                                International scientific community has concluded that there is compelling evidence of
                                climate change. Developing countries like India are considered particularly vulnerable
                                to climatic changes due to their dependency on climate-sensitive sectors, such as
                                agriculture, fisheries, forestry, water, and other natural resources, and limited
                                capacities to anticipate and respond to climatic changes. Most of the Indian rural
                                population live in harsh climate regions of mountains, deserts, and river deltas, which
                                makes them more susceptible to changing climate. The potential impacts of climate change
                                are very broad.</p>
