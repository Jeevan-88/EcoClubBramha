Since it has been working in the fields of Environment, Health, Education, Women & Child Development, Sustainable Agriculture, Climate Change and Disabled Welfare in Mahbubnagar District. Our organization’s main motto is reached unreached and need based services provide to the rural and urban community. Our organization identified the most vulnerable group in the society that is Mentally Challenged Persons and their families. Before 1998 in our Mahbubnagar district there is no Special School for Mentally Challenged children. Based on this cause we conducted a survey on disability with our staff & Volunteers identified some of M R children in the district

                <p>Then we approached the District Administration and NIMH Secunderabad for support to provide the services to the MR children in our area.    After this process we established an Institution for the Mentally Challenged Children, named as a “Brahma Institute for the Mentally Handicapped” in the year 1998. A Special School for Intellectual Disabled (I D). </p>
                <p>
